* Demo 1 required me to control the robot car using a remote control. based on the input, the controller would transmit a character via the bluetooth module tp the cars reciever module. The the micro controller on the car would act according to the character received. for the analog stick, I implemented a 4-directional control scheme where the character sent depended on the reading of the potentiometer.
* Demo 2 Required us to write a program that utilised the infrared sensors on the bottom of the car to track a line and follow the track in a specific pattern.
* Demo 3 was to demonstrate that the car can measure distance using a ultrasonic sensor and stop itself before hitting a wall. The tolerance for this was at least 10cm from the wall.
* Demo 4A required us to hit a ping pong ball betwwen 2 cars 3 time in succession befor the ball stopped moving. we were instructed to use our controllers for this demo.
* Demo 4B required us to combine the logic from the previous 2 Demos and write 2 programs one for each car. Car 1 is supposed to follow a set path approaching car 2 then stop while car after detecting that car one is less than 5 cm away from it starts its route. it will loop back to its starting positions where Car 1 is waiting, which upon detecting car 2 performs a u-turn and follows its original path back to its starting position.
